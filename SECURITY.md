# Security Guidelines for Aptos Aura Weaver

## Frontend Security

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- The application uses a strict CSP to prevent XSS attacks
- Only trusted domains are allowed for script and style loading
- Data URIs are allowed for images generated by the application

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated both on client and server side
- Mood seed inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- Transaction count validation prevents invalid data processing

### Wallet Integration Security
- Only trusted wallet adapters are loaded
- Wallet connection requests include proper error handling
- No sensitive wallet data is stored in localStorage

### Environment Variables
- API keys and secrets are stored in environment variables
- Never commit sensitive credentials to version control
- Use different credentials for development and production

## Smart Contract Security

### Access Control
- Collection creation is restricted to authorized accounts
- Token minting functions include proper validation
- Error handling prevents unauthorized operations

### Input Sanitization
- Mood seed length limits prevent DoS attacks
- Token name validation prevents malformed inputs
- URI validation ensures proper resource references

### Gas Optimization
- Functions are designed to minimize gas consumption
- Batch operations are avoided to prevent gas limit issues
- Error conditions fail fast to save gas

## Deployment Security

### HTTPS Enforcement
- All communications must use HTTPS in production
- HSTS headers force secure connections
- Mixed content is strictly prohibited

### CORS Configuration
- API endpoints have restrictive CORS policies
- Only authorized origins can access resources
- Credentials are not exposed to unauthorized domains

### IPFS Security
- IPFS uploads are validated before blockchain submission
- Metadata includes integrity checks
- Gateway URLs are validated before use

## Monitoring and Logging

### Error Tracking
- All errors are logged with appropriate context
- User-facing errors don't expose sensitive information
- Error rates are monitored for anomalies

### Security Events
- Failed authentication attempts are logged
- Suspicious input patterns trigger alerts
- IPFS upload failures are tracked

## Recommended Security Practices

### Development
1. Use environment-specific configurations
2. Never commit API keys to version control
3. Regular dependency updates
4. Code reviews for security issues

### Production
1. Enable all security headers
2. Monitor for unusual activity
3. Regular security audits
4. Incident response plan in place

### User Education
1. Clear wallet connection instructions
2. Explanation of data usage policies
3. Security best practices documentation

## Security Contact

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to the development team immediately. Do not post security issues in public forums.
