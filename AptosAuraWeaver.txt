Aptos Aura Weaver is a simple, novel dApp for the Aptos blockchain that generates personalized, animated NFT art ("auras") based on a user’s on-chain activity (e.g., transaction history) combined with a custom "mood seed" (e.g., a phrase or emoji). Users connect their wallet (e.g., Petra), input a seed, and see a dynamic visual (e.g., swirling patterns or particles) created using p5.js, which they can mint as an NFT for sharing or collecting. The dApp leverages Aptos’s Move language for secure NFT minting, high throughput (~160,000 TPS) for fast transactions, and low fees for accessibility. It’s designed for casual, non-utilitarian fun, encouraging social sharing (e.g., on X) with potential viral appeal.
